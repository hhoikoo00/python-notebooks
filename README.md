# Python Notebooks

## Introduction

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that I created for learning various aspects of the Python programming language, specifically the following set of libraries:

* ```numpy```
* ```matplotlib```
* ```pandas```
* ...

All notebooks are in the root directory. Specifically, notebooks with "ex-" as a prefix contain various exercises for the respective modules.

## Directory

```out/``` contains pdf versions of some of the notebooks.

```data/``` contains auxilary files required for some of the notebooks.

## Usage

1. Set up a Python virtual environment with the following command:
```
python3 -m venv env-notebook
``` 
2. Install requirements with pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
